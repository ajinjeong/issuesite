		<div class="description"> 22 million women living in poverty in the US cannot afford menstrual hygiene products. One study in Obstetrics and Gynecology demonstrated that 64% of women reported ever having difficulty affording menstrual products, such as pads, tampons, or reusable products like menstrual cups. And 21% reported that they were unable to afford these products every month. People who are homeless or incarcerated are at particularly high risk of not having access to adequate menstrual hygiene products.
